## Installation

Option 2 - Upload the plugin file:

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to `Plugins` > `Add new` > `Upload Plugin`.
2. Click `Choose File`, select the plugin `zip`, and click `Install Now`.
3. Click `Activate Plugin` when prompted.

Option 3 - By SFTP:

## Set Up Lightrail Payment Gateway

In order to connect with the Lightrail API, the plugin needs valid Lightrail API keys. You can generate API keys in your  [Lightrail dashboard](https://www.lightrail.com/app/#/login): click your user badge in the top right corner, go to `Account Settings`, and then click on `API Keys`.

Once you have created an API key, enter it in the Lightrail for WooCommerce settings page. The settings are in the `WooCommerce` > `Settings` > `Checkout` tab where you can scroll down to the bottom of the page under `Payment Gateways ` and find `Gift Code` by Lightrail.
Alternatively, you can directly go to the settings page by clicking on the `Settings` link under Lightrail for WooCommerce plugin name on Wordpress `Plugins` page.

## WooCommerce Coupons

To avoid confusion on the checkout page, if you are using Lightrail Gift Cards, we strongly recommend that you disable WooCommerce coupons.
